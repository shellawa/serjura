## Introduction

This document is designed to test the rendering capabilities of the **Svelte 5 + Unified** pipeline. It covers standard Markdown syntax as well as GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) extensions.

---

## 1. Typography & Emphasis

This section tests basic text formatting. You should see **bold text**, _italic text_, and **_bold italic text_**. We also support ~~strikethrough text~~ which is useful for changelogs.

**Special Characters:**

- Ellipsis ...
- En-dash --
- Em-dash ---
- Quotes: "Smart Quotes" and 'Single Smart Quotes'

> **Note:** This is a standard blockquote. It should have a distinct border or background color to separate it from the main text flow.

## 2. Headings & Structure

### Heading Level 3

#### Heading Level 4

##### Heading Level 5

###### Heading Level 6

We need to ensure that `rehype-slug` works correctly with special characters.

### Heading with `Code` and **Bold**

### Heading with Emoji 🚀

### Duplicate Heading

### Duplicate Heading

(The above two headings should generate unique IDs like `#duplicate-heading` and `#duplicate-heading-1`).

## 3. Lists and Nesting

### Unordered Lists

- Level 1 Item
- Level 1 Item
  - Level 2 Item (Indented)
  - Level 2 Item
    - Level 3 Item
    - Level 3 Item
- Level 1 Item

### Ordered Lists

1.  First Step
2.  Second Step
    1.  Sub-step A
    2.  Sub-step B
3.  Third Step

### Task Lists (GFM)

- [x] Design the database schema
- [x] Set up SvelteKit project
- [ ] Implement the markdown parser
- [ ] Fix the "window is not defined" error

## 4. Tables (GFM)

Testing alignment and styling.

| Command      | Description                    | Is Safe? | Rating |
| :----------- | :----------------------------- | :------: | -----: |
| `git status` | List all new or modified files |   Yes    |   100% |
| `git diff`   | Show file differences          |   Yes    |    85% |
| `rm -rf /`   | Deletes everything             |  **No**  |     0% |

## 5. Blockquotes & Complexity

> This is a level 1 blockquote.
>
> > This is a nested level 2 blockquote.
> > It tests how your CSS handles indentation and borders.
>
> Back to level 1.
